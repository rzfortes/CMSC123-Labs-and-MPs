#MPA3: Be a Maze, Be Very Amazed

Given a maze (hash symbol for walls, period for "walkable" paths, o for the entrance/starting point, and * for the end/exit), this MP 
finds a path solution starting from 'o' to '*'. If a path solution was found, period characters will be replaced by 'x' and will be 
written into the file "maze.out". If there is no solution, the original maze will just be displayed.

Deadline of submission: November 30, 2016; submitted.

MPA for Stacks&Queues under Sir Ryan Ciriaco M. Dulaca.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Errors:

 - If there is no solution, the original maze will also be written into the file "maze.out". [Must fix]
 - Works for Stacks, but not for Queues. (in the Agenda class) [Must fix]
